# Application to Cryptography

An MPI parallelized program used for encrypting messages by parallelizing matrix multiplication process. This simple program
constructs a (3*3) "encoding matrix" manually and multiplies it by "message matrix" but of course the size of encoding matrix can be
modified to be bigger and the more bigger it is the more secure encryption and beneficial parallelization.
